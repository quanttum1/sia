# sia

**sia** is a simple & cute terminal-based (speed)-reader for plain text files that loves and respects you as a user ‚ù§Ô∏è
It displays your text word by word at certain speed, with simple interactive controls.
When you quit, it removes everything you‚Äôve already read from the file so you can continue where you left off next time.

‚ö†Ô∏è Windows support is incomplete right now (POSIX/Linux/macOS works fine).

## Features

* Reads plain text files word by word, at a customisable speed (characters per minute).
* Non-blocking keyboard input:

  * **Space** ‚Üí pause/resume
  * **q** ‚Üí quit and save progress
  * **-** ‚Üí slow down (‚àí200 cpm)
  * **+ or =** ‚Üí speed up (+200 cpm)
* Progress persistence: when you quit with `q`, the already-read part of the file is deleted.
* UTF-8 aware (basic multi-byte character handling).
* Cute, minimal, self-contained single C file.
